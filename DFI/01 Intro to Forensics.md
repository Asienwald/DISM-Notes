Overview
---
- digital forensics
    - application of comp science and investigative procedures for legal purpose
    - involves the analysis of digital evidence after proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with math, use of validated tools, repeatability, reporting and possible exper presentation
- history
    - Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) created to ensure consistency in federal proceedings
    - FBI comp abalysis and resp team (CART)
        - 1984
        - handle cases with digital evidence
        - by late 1990s, cart teamed up w department of def comp forensics lab (DCFL)
    - 4th amendment of US constitution protects our rights to be secure from search and seizure
        - goal to protect right to privacy and unreasonable intrusions from govt


Case Law
---
- current laws cannot keep up with rate of tech change
- when stateus (law passed by legislative body) dont exist, **case law** used
    - allow legal counsel to apply prev similar cases to current to address ambiguity in laws
- examiners must know recent court rulings on search & seizure in electronic env

### Developing Digital Forensics Resources
- supplement knowledge by
    - developing and maintaining contact with relevant investigative professionals
    - join comp user grps in pub/priv sectors
        - Eg. computer tech investigators network (CTIN) to discuss probs examiners encounter
    - consult other experts

### Digital Investigations
- 2 categories
    - public sector investigations
    - private sector investigations
- the diff
    - involve govt agencies resp for criminal investigations and prosecution
    - be familiar with 4th amendment of US constitution
        - restrict govt search & seizure
        - dept of justice (DOJ) updates info on comp search and seizure regularly
    - prib sector investigations focus more on company policy violations
- role of digital forensics prof is to gather evidence to prove that suspect commited crime or violated company policy
    - collect evidence to offer in court/corporate inquiry
        - investigate suspect comp
        - preserve evidence on diff comp
- chain of custody
    - route evidence takes from time found until case closed/goes to court

### Following Legal Processes
- criminal inves. usually begins when someone finds evidence/witness a crime
    - witness/victim make **allegation** to police
- police interview complainant and writes report
- report processed and management decide whether to start inves. or log info in police blotter
    - **blotter** - historical db of prev crimes

#### Entities
- digital evidence first responder (DEFR)
    - arrive 1st at incident scene
    - assess situation
    - take precautions to acquire and preserve evidence
- digital evidence specialist (DES)
    - has skill to analyse data
    - determine when another specialist shld be called in to assist
- affidavit
    - sworn statement of supprt of facts abt/evidence of crime
        - must include exhibits that support allegation

### Private Sector Investigations
- priv sector involve priv companies and laywers who address company policy violations and litigation disputes
    - Eg. wrongful termination
- businesses strive to minimise/eliminate litigation
- can involve
    - E-mail harassment, falsification of data, gender and age discrimination, embezzlement, sabotage, and industrial espionage
- businesses can reduce risk of litigation by publishing and maintaining **policies** employees can read and follow easily
    - most impt policies define rules for using company's comps and networks
        - AKA acceptable use policy
    - can avoid litigation with warning banner to inform users that orgs reserve right to inspect comp systems and network traffic at will
- **line of authority**
    - states who has legal right to initiate inves., who can take possession of evidence and who can have access to evidence
