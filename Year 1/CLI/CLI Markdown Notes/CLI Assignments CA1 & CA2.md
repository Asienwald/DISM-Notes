### Introduction
It is now 2020, and information technology has become very pervasive in every aspect of society, including the government, businesses and households.

According to the annual survey on infocomm usage by households and individuals conducted by IMDA in 2018, about 89% of resident households had computer access and about 98% of households with school-going children had computer access at home. 

The high accessibility to computers and the internet has led to a greater amount of convenience to the citizens of Singapore, but conveniences often come at a price.

Having majority of Singaporeans have computer access also means that most of them are at risk of being a victim of computer crime or have the necessary materials and means to engage in computer crime.

In 2018, there were 1024 cases on crime relating to the use of computers reported under the Computer Misuse Act, which is an increase of 40% compared to the previous year.

This has led to the implementation of the Computer Misuse Act (CMA) to both enhance security in areas like bank transfers, public utilities, traffic light control systems etc. and deter computer users from commiting such crimes using punishments to commensurate with the severity of the offences.

We will elaborate more on the Computer Misuse Act in the following report.


### Intro to CMA & parts
#### Section 8 - Unauthorised disclosure of access code
Section 8 is targeted at unauthorised password disclosure.

This section states that any unauthorised person who knowingly discloses any password, access code or any other means of gaining access to a program or data in any company.

The person will only be guilty of the offence if he did so
- for wrongful gain
- for unlawful purpose or
- knwing it will cause wrongful loss to others



#### Section 8A - Supplying etc., personal info obtained in contravention of certain provisions
Section 8A is targeted at dealing in hacked personal information to commit any offence

- obtains or retains the personal information
- supplies, offers to supply, transmits or makes available, by any means the personal information

However, It is not an offence under subsection (1)(a) if the person obtained or retained the personal information for a purpose other than —
- for use in committing or facilitating the commission of any offence under any written law or
- for supply, transmission or making available by any means for the personal information to be used in committing, or in facilitating the commission of, any offence under any written law

An example is when criminals trade in hacked credit card information, even though they are not responsible for hacking it


#### Section 8B - Obtaining etc. items for use in certain offences
Section 8B is targeted at dealing in "hacking tools" to commit computer crimes.

The section states that a person shall be guilty of an offence if the person

#### Section 9 - Enhanced punishment for offences involving protected computers
Section 9 is targeted at unauthorised access to protected computers.

The section states that where access to any protected computer is obtained in the course of the commission of an offence under section 3, 5, 6 or 7, the person convicted of such an offence shall, in lieu of the punishment prescribed in those sections, be liable to a punishment (see Annex A)

This section states that any person who abets the commission of or who attempts to commit or does any act preparatory to or in furtherance of the commission of any offence under this Act shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable on conviction to the punishment provided for the offence.

For an offence to be committed under this section, it is immaterial where the act in question took place. 


#### Section 11 - Territorial Nature of CMA
This section states that the provisions of this Act shall have effect, in relation to any person, whatever his nationality or citizenship, outside as well as within Singapore.

Where an offence under this Act is committed by any person in any place outside Singapore, he may be dealt with as if the offence had been committed within Singapore. 

This act applies if

- damage to the national security, defence or foreign relations of Singapore.

### Start of Essay

The features and functions of a computer are endless. From basic web surfing to gaming and using software, this also introduces many different ways the computer can be used for crime.

In this section we will walk through the various types of computer crimes.

__Hacking__
Hacking is the act of using tools to gain unauthorised access into another user's computer. This act is usually done with a harmful motive, fueled by personal gain.

An example of hacking is using a password cracking tool found online to gain crack the password of your neighbour's WiFi and steal his network data.

__Computer Fraud__
Fraud is event when a person is scammed with the purpose to gain confidential or personal information or unauthorised access.

Such acts include impersonation and identity theft, which aims to have victims believe you have the identity of someone else, usually somebody close to them like a blood relative or friend to steal data or lend money from them.

In 2018, 378 Business impersonation scams led to businesses suffering approximately $58 million in losses.

Another example fraud are love scams, which are one of the most common type of cyber-crime found in Singapore. These attacks usually occur on popular dating sites like Tinder where scammers usually masquerade as an attractive foreign individual and befriends the victims online, only to then claim to be in a pinch and request for monetary help from the victim.

Clouded with love or their human instinct to help others in need, the victim will then transfer the money, often through online bank transfers or gift cards to aid the scammer, only for him to disappear along with their money.

__Modification of Computer Contents__
This is the act of unauthorised modification of the contents of any computer, program or data like intentionally deleting or corrupting data wiht the intent to cause harm or disruption to others.

__Unauthorised Use of Computer Services__

Some examples are using electro-magnetic waves to interfere with a computer, rendering it unable to function properly or unauthorised "locking" of a specific program on a computer and preventing the owner from using it.

__Unathorised Disclosure of Password__
The act of knowingly disclosing a password or access code without authority with an unlawful motive.

An example is disclosing the access code to your boss's company email and causing it to be compromised, introducing a huge security threat to the company.

__Software Piracy__
Ilegally duplicating original content like songs, software, movies etc.
This translates into copyright infringement as companies and developers suffer huge income losses when their products are illegally reproduced and spread.

__Cyber Bullying/Harassment/Stalking__
Posting harmful remarks of others online and causing distress; unlawful stalking of others resulting in distress.

__Abetments__
