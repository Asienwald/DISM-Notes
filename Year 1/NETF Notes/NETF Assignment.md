### Proposed Network Setup

#### Network Topologies
- star in star/pt to multiple topology
- switched logical topology

#### Protocols
- basic data communication
    - HTTPS for web
    - TCP/IP
    - UDP
- security protocols - implement security over network comms
    - HTTPS
    - SSL - encryption layer
    - SFTP - secure file sharing
- network management protocols - network governance & maintenance
    - ICMP
    - SNMP - for mail
- SSH for remote access to workstations
- DHCP for dynamic IP addressing


#### Communication Media
- wired
    - use fiber-optic [single mode fiber] for cables connecting networks separated by level (since its more than 90m)
        - level 6, 7 and 8
    - use shielded twisted pair for networks in same level
        - #07-123 and #07-125
        - #08-123 and #08-125
- wireless
    - use wireless access point
    - 5ghz and not 2.4ghz
        - 5ghz has smaller range but faster data rate compared to 2.4ghz
            - higher freq, higher bandwidth
        - since has one AP in each network, don't need huge range
        - better security too, since no leakage of wireless network

### Hybird Network

We are using Hybrid Network for our Network Design Proposal. A hybrid network uses both wireless and wired connection for a network. The reason why we chose hybrid network is because it is scalable and flexible...

### Advantages of Wired Network
- Reliable
    - prevent eavesdropping, not susceptible to interference (fiber-optic)
    - Resolved connection dropped issues
- Higher/Faster internet speed
    - No signal attenuation 
    - 
- Increased security
    - Cannot be easily intercepted since there is no transmission of medium (air waves) involved. 

### Advantages of Wireless network
- Access and Availability 
    - Allows users to communicate on the move within the same network area. 
- Cost Saving
    - Cheaper and easier to install
- Flexibility
    - Employees can continue with their work from home without needing a dedicated computer
