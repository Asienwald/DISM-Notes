08 Evidence & Analysis I
---
### Standard of Proof
#### Standard of Proof - Criminal
- in criminal cases, when prosecution required to prove facts in issue (ingredients/elements of crime), he must do so __beyond reasonable doubt__
- if accused relies on any defences/exceptions to liability spelt out in statutes, he must prove them based on __balance of probabilities__

#### Standard of Proof - Civil
- in civil cases, plaintiff & defendant must as general rule prove the facts in issue which they assert & any defences they rellied on based on __balance of probabilities__

#### Beyond Reasonable Doubt
- need not reach certainty but must carry highe degree of probability
- if evidence so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence "of course it's possible, but not in the least possible", the case is beyond reasonable doubt
    - nothing short of that will suffice

#### Balance of probabilities
- must carry reasonable degree of probability
    - but not high as required in criminal case
- if evidence is such that a tribunal might say "we think it probable than not", the burden is discharged
- but if probabilities are equal, then its not

### Unauthorised Use

    - confidential info came from plaintiff
    - disclosure/use inconsistent with limited purpose for which info was given
    - use of confidential info w/o plaintiff's consent


### Liabilities
