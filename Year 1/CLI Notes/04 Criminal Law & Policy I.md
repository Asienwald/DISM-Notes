### Functions & objectives of punishment
- 4 reasons
    - retribution
    - deterrence
    - prevention
        - incapitation
        - incarceration
    - reformation & rehabilitation
- Eg. teen raped & robbed prostitute gets jail & caning
    - prosecution sought longer jail term due to seriousness of crimes committed with deterrence as main sentencing consideration
    - defence sought reformative training due to age of offender


#### Retribution
- act of punishing for wrongdoing
- theory that there's social equilibrium of duties, responsibilities & interests
- theory that anyone who disturbs this balance of duties & interests shld be held responsible for their actions
    - dealt with severely
- connotes society's hatred of criminal behaviour
- offender shld be suitably punished according o his culpability & seriousness of crime committed

#### Deterrence
- deter - to discourage, restrain
- purpose to discourage commission of similar crimes/offences in future
- may be specific as applying to that particular offender/criminal to discourage him from reoffending
- in wider perspective, may also be general as applying to society or public as whole

#### Prevention
- incarcerate - to confine
    - incapacitate - to deprive/make incapable
- emphasises protection of society from criminals
- necessitates confinement of such criminals away from mainstream society
    - offender locked away so cannot cause further harm

#### Reformation & Rehabilitation
- considers reform & rehabilitation of offender
    - reform - persuade/help person to improve/amend, relinquish or give up what was wrong
    - rehabilitate - help wrongdoer stop his criminal ways
        - change/restore to good condition
- punishment must be sufficient & targeted
- offender might pretend he has made progress in treatment
- once criminal realises errors of his ways & prepared to change for better he can resume norm & useful role in society after paid penalty for his crime

- __Example__
