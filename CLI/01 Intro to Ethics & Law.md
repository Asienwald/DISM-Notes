    - rule-based states that its ethically wrong
        - against law to commit murder
    - consequence-based states its ethically correct
        - good of many outweigh his murder

- choose action that bring greatest collective good for all people

### Rule-Based Reasoning

Not by Legislation Alone
---
- cannot legislate every aspect of human behaviour
    - ethical behaviour where we are considerate to welfare of others must be internalised
- motivated by self-interest is okay, but selfishness w/o regard of reasonable interest of others is unethical but not illegal
- ethical behaviour is hallmark of a gracious & caring society
