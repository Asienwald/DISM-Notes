    - no need to provide counsel immediately upon arrest

- issue of discovery
    - no legal obligation to disclose info yo accused
    - lack of info makes it difficult for def counsel to advise accused to preperly prepare his def
        - what def lawyers need most are statements from clients & witnesses


### Statements
#### Prosecution's Response
- if accused telling truth, shld be able to recollect what he told police
- use of statements
    - prosecution expected to impeach (call into question) credibility of accused if he deviates from statements
        - means he's lying
        - if judge agrees with impeachment, has direct impact on accused's case & def
    - __Example__
        - sg doc helping his American partner dupe the authorities into issuing him a pass to work here
            - confessed to police that he submitted his blood instead of his HIV-positive partner's
            - during court he retracted on his confessions to police and said they were false
            - he got cowabunga-ed
                - Ler was convicted and sentenced for abetment of cheating and giving a false statement to a public servant
