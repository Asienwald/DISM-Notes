Computer Output Evidence
---
- pervasive role played by comps in society & increase in computerisation of records will lead to more comp output presented in evidence


#### Sections 35 & 36 of Evidence Act
- introduced in 1996 when comp tech was in its infancy hence cautious approach was taken
- comp output can only be admitted if
    - its produced in an approved process
    - shown to be produced by properly operating comp which was properly used

- repeal of sections 35 & 36
    - cumbersome process & not consonant with modern realities
    - position now is that comp output evi shld not be treated differently from other evidence
    - hence repealed

### Presumptions in Relation to Electronic Records
- there'll be new presumptions facilitating admission of electronic records introduced by Evidence Act 2012
    - Eg. if device properly used & accurately communicates on electronic record, its presumed that an electronic record communicated by that device is accurately communicated
- unless evidence to contrary adduced, court presumes that any electronic record generated/recorded/stored is authentic if its established that electronic record was generated in the usual & ordinary course of business by a person who was not a party to the proceedings & did not generate under the control of the party seeking to introduce the record
    - Eg. A seeks to cite evi against B in form of electronic record
        - fact that record generated by in usual & ordinary course of business by C, a neutral 3rd pt is relevant fact for court ot presume its authentic

- unless evi to contrary is adduced, whr electronic record generated/recorded/stored by pt who is adverse/harmful in interest to the pt seeking to adduce/cite the evi, court shall presume that record is authentic in relation to authentication issues arising from generation/recording/storage of the record
    - Eg. A seeks to cite evi against B in form of electronic record
        - fact that record was generated by B who opposes the relevance of evi is relevant fact for court to presume its authentic

#### Example - Telemedia Pacific Group Ltd Credit Agricole

Processes for Validating Electronic Record are Relevant Facts
---
- section 9 of evi act - to clarify that processes for validating an electronic record are relevant facts
- example
    - method & manner whr record was generated/comm/received/stored, reliability of devices & circumstances which devices were used/operated to generate record may be relevant facts as authenticating the record

### Approved Process
- section 116A(5) - minister may make regulations providing for process by which doc may be recorded/stored through use of an imaging system
    - includes providing for appointment of 1/more persons/orgs to certify these systems & their use\
    - approved process in subsection 6 means process has been approved in accordance with provisions of such regulations
- section 116A(6) - whr electronic record was recorded/stored from doc produced pursuant to an approved process, court shall presume, unless evi to contrary is adduced, the record accurately reproduces that doc


### Rules for Filing & Receiving Evidence in Court using InfoTech
- Section 36A - rules committee constituted under supreme court of judicature act & fam justice rules comm constituted under fam justice act 2014, may make rules to provide for filing/receiving/recording of evi & docs in court by use of info tech in such form/manner/method as may be prescribed

- (2) w/o prejudice to generality of subsection (1), such rules may
    - modify such provisions of this act as may be necessary to facilitate the use of electronic filing of docs in court
    - provide for burden of proof & rebuttable presumptions in relation to identity & authority of person sending/filing evi/docs by use of info tech
    - provide for auth of evi & docs files/received by use of info tech

- __need to know__
    - whr evi is
    - what evi means
    - how to put it tgt


### Sources of Evidence
- 3 basic sources
    - users
        - 1st hand observations
    - systems 
        - including backups
        - log files
        - intruder remnants (processes, files etc)
    - networks/comms
        - netflow logs
        - firewall logs
        - modem banks/telephone logs
- basically rely on logs recovered from compromised system

### Mutable Evidence
- comp evi is endlessly changeable
    - intruder might add/remove/modify log entries
    - might compromise system components that maintain the logs
    - you might modify sth during investigation

### Chain of Custody
- who had access to evi?
- what procedures followed when working with evi?
- how can we show that our analysis is based on copies identical to orig evi?
- __BY DOCUMENTATION & TIMESTAMPS__


Obtaining Computer Related Evidence
---
- to obtain comp-related evi, 4 steps must be taken
    - identify evi
        - identify type of info available
        - determine how to best retrieve
    - preserve evi
        - with least amt of change possible
        - must be able to account for any changes
    - analyse evi
        - extract - may produce binary "gunk" that isn't human readable
        - process - make it humanly readable
        - interpret - requires deep understanding of how things fit tgt
    - present evi
        - to management, attorneys, in court etc
        - acceptance depends on
            - manner of presentation
                - did you make it convincing/understandable?
            - qualifications of presenter
            - credibility of processes used to preserve & analyse evi
        - especially impt when presenting evi in court

### Evidence Preservation
- make copy
    - generate copy
    - verify accuracy of copy through timestamp
- document
    - who collected it from whr, how, when, maybe why
- give copy/orig to custodian
    - custodian gives copies to others
    - document chain of custody
    - fewer custodians better - fewer to testify


Best Evidence Rule
---
- when nothing better, court will resort to admitting evi that otherwise be inadmissible in other cases
- rule may apply to cases whr evi excluded as better evi is available
- for comp output, best evi in decreasing order of desirability
    - orig disk
    - binary copy of orig disk
    - log file from disk
        - Eg. UNIX wtmp
    - records from within file
    - contents of file
    - collection of files
    - collection of files with attributes intact
- byte stream img of disk is good for most purposes, but not all purposes
