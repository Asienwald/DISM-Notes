#### How it work?
- application of precedent "stare decisis" (whr facts of case are similar)
    - decision of higher court binds all lower courts in same hirarchy
    - court not bound by own prior decision
        - may be persuasive authority
    - not bound by decision of court from another hierarchy
        - may be persuasive authority
