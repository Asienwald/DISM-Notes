### Disposal of Data in Electronic Media
- physical destruction of media itself to render stored data inaccessible
    - Eg. cut it up/smash it
- disposal of data in media only
    - specialised software tools used to securely erase all data in media
    - just moving to recycle bin is insufficient as it's recoverable even after the bin is emptied
- companies can choose disposal methods as long as data cannot be recovered

### Points to Note
- companies liable for employee's acts/breaches of PDPA
- engaging external service providers to dispose docs containing data doesnt relieve companies of their PDPA obligations to protect data
